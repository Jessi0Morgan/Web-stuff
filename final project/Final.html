        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I've just completed my first semester of Database Administrations. I'm excited to enter the new year with a whole new way of thinking as i've
            decided to make some big changes to myself. I'm very much excited for this prospect.

            (If my website looks like it has no css added to it please let me know as it works for me and wouldn't have sent it in without it meeting my standards first.)
