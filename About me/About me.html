                <p>My favourite things to do after Classes is to hang out with my friends and play games!
                    My favourite food is Sushi and a good Homemade Meatloaf, gotta love the homestyle classics.
                    I graudated highschool a year ago and worked for that year off as I decided where and what to study for college.
                    Before I took the year off I would have been studying culinary and not IT DBA.
