                <p>My favourite things to do after Classes is to hang out with my friends and play games!
                    My favourite food is Sushi and a good Homemade Meatloaf, gotta love the homestyle classics.
                    I graudated highschool a year ago and worked for that year off as I decided where and what to study for college.
                    Before I took the year off I would have been studying culinary and not IT DBA.

                    <p>Essentially this is to kinda just talk about one of my favourite
                        webcomic series that was published in Korea and translated to English.

                        Solo Lveling is a very near and dear webcomic to me as it has 270 chapters
                        and I started reading around chapter 97. The webcomic has many ups and downs as you 
                        follow the main character during his hardships in his world.
